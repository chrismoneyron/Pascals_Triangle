				This site contains tools to help you learn about Pascal's Triangle.
				You will be able to use a tool to select what row in Pascal's
				Triangle you want to see and another tool that allows you to perform
				any probability calculation that you would like. You can choose
				to calculate:

			<ul id = "intro_list">
				<li>the intersection of two independent events</li>
				<li>the union of two independent events</li>
				<li>the probability of a single event</li>
			</ul>
			<p id = "intro">
				For each situation described above, you may choose to calculate the 
				events at different depths in Pascal's Triangle.
